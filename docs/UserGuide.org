* Introduction 

Duckling is a Clojure library that parses text into structured data:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
“the first Tuesday of October” => {:value "2014-10-07T00:00:00.000-07:00"
                                   :grain :day}
#+END_SRC

Duckling is:
- Agnostic :: it makes no assumption on the kind of data you want to extract, or the language. You can train it with a combination of examples and rules for any task that takes a string as input and produces a map as output.
- Probabilistic :: in the real world, a given input string may produce dozens of potential results. Duckling assigns a probability on each result. It decides which results are more probable by using the corpus of examples given in the configuration. Owing to that (and unlike, say, regular expressions or formal grammars), rules can afford to be extremely loose. It makes them much easier to write, and much more robust to user input in the wild.
- Extensible :: it leverages the power of Clojure’s "code is data" philosophy.

If you know NLP, Duckling is "almost" a *Probabilistic Context Free Grammar*. But not exactly! It tries to be more flexible and easier to configure than a formal PCFG. It also tries to learn better from examples.


* Getting started

The English module  will allow you to capture the following dimensions:
