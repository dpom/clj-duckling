As of May 1st, 2017 the Duckling team deprecated the Clojure version in
favor of [[https://github.com/facebookincubator/duckling][the new
Duckling]]. See their
[[https://wit.ai/blog/2017/05/01/new-duckling][blog post announcement]].

My intention is to continue the clojure development of the Duckling
project so I forked it in this new project.

* Duckling


Duckling is a Clojure library that parses text into structured data:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   "the car is 2 meters long and costs 3000$." => [{:dim :amount-of-money, :body "3000$", :value {:type "value", :value 3000, :unit "USD"}, :start 35, :end 40}
                                                   {:dim :distance, :body "2 meters", :value {:type "value", :value 2, :unit "metre"}, :start 11, :end 19}]
#+END_EXAMPLE



** Getting started

For lein add to your project.clj:
[[https://clojars.org/dpom/clj-duckling][https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/dpom/clj-duckling.svg]]

In =core= source file you can find some examples of how to use the library. My [[https://github.com/dpom/nluserv][nluserv]] project use also clj-duckling.

See the [[https://dpom.github.io/clj-duckling/][documentation]]  and [[https://dpom.github.io/clj-duckling/api/index.html][API]] for more information.
