As of May 1st, 2017 the Duckling team deprecated the Clojure version in
favor of [[https://github.com/facebookincubator/duckling][the new
Duckling]]. See their
[[https://wit.ai/blog/2017/05/01/new-duckling][blog post announcement]].

My intention is to continue the clojure development of the Duckling
project so I forked it in this new project.

* Duckling

[[https://clojars.org/dpom/clj-duckling][https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/dpom/clj-duckling.svg]]

Duckling is a Clojure library that parses text into structured data:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   "the car is 2 meters long and costs 3000$." => [{:dim :amount-of-money, :body "3000$", :value {:type "value", :value 3000, :unit "$"}, :start 35, :end 40}
                                                   {:dim :distance, :body "2 meters", :value {:type "value", :value 2, :unit "metre"}, :start 11, :end 19}]
#+END_EXAMPLE



** Getting started

To use Duckling in your project, you just need two functions: =load!= to
load the default configuration, and =parse= to parse a string.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (ns myproject.core
      (:require [clj-duckling.core :as p]))

    (p/load!) ;; Load all languages

    (p/parse :en$core ;; core configuration for English ; see also :fr$core, :es$core, :zh$core
             "wake me up the last Monday of January 2015 at 6am"
             [:time]) ;; We are interested in :time expressions only ; see also :duration, :temperature, etc.

    ;; => [{:label :time
    ;;        :start 15
    ;;        :end 49
    ;;        :value {:type "value", :value "2015-01-26T06:00:00.000-02:00", :grain :hour}
    ;;        :body "last Monday of January 2015 at 6am"}]
#+END_SRC
